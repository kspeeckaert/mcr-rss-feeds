# MCR to RSS

Simple workflow that generates RSS feeds based on metadata from the Microsoft Container Registry.

All you need to do is modify the `repositories.txt` to your liking, optionally change the scheduling of the workflow, and copy the URLs of the generated XML files into your favourite feed reader.

For a Docker solution, see [docker-hub-rss](https://github.com/TheConnMan/docker-hub-rss).
